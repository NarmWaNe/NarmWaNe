- ğŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m Nene
- ğŸ‘€ My Contract: 093-1816131
- ğŸŒ± I'm Software Engineering from Mae Fah Luang Unversity. I have tested designing/developing websites, and applications and running a small game server. And I like to study new things. I didn't know before because we are not stationary. I have a goal in my career that is interesting and exciting in my life.
